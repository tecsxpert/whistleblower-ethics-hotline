Manages the ChromaDB vector store and ChromaDB embedding function.

Responsibilities:
  - Create / reuse the 'complaints' ChromaDB collection
  - Use ChromaDB's DefaultEmbeddingFunction for text embedding
  - Seed domain knowledge documents on first run
  - Expose: add_documents(), similarity_search(), document_count()

Thread safety: _get_collection() uses double-checked locking via a threading.RLock
so the collection is initialised only once in concurrent requests.
